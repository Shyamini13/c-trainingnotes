Object oriented programming :>>>

	OOP is faster and easier to execute
	OOP provides a clear structure for the programs

Abstraction:
	Data abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user.
	abstract keyword 

	Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).

	Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the derived class (inherited from).

	syntax: abstract class Animal 
		{
 		 public abstract void animalSound();
  	 	 public void sleep() 
  		{
   			 Console.WriteLine("Zzz");
  		}
		}

Inheritance :
	it is possible to inherit fields and methods from one class to another.
	Derived Class (child) - the class that inherits from another class
	Base Class (parent) - the class being inherited from

properties and encapsulation:
	The meaning of Encapsulation, is to make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users. To achieve this, you must:

	declare fields/variables as private
	provide public get and set methods, through properties, to access and update the value of a private field

Polymorphism :
	Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.
